# AppCompare
This application is collecting data from android devices and make a comparison between the applications on the database and the applications of the device.Therefore the outcome is a percentage index that shows the similarity between the device and the database.

The project is being developed for educational and research purposes.We try to compare devices based on application similarity index.It is easier for a virus to spread through a popular application.In short, higher similarity index means higher virus vulnerability risk.

It is important to mention that the application will make an application list of the device and will send it to our servers.We do not collect sensitive user data.
